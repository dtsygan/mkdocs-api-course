# Welcome to API course overview 

This site was created by a technical writer based on the results of one training course.

## About me

My name is Darya Tsygan. I have been working as a technical writer for 3 years. I love writing and understanding complex things. Therefore, as training, I was interested in taking a course on API documentation. 

I write in Russian. English is not my strong point. But on this website I wanted to complicate my task.

## About course

This course was created by documentat.io, which is a famous company in the technical writing community.
We with our techer Denis Mazin studied the structure of API documentation, tools for its creation, assembly and publication. We also analyzed documentation from different companies, sent requests to APIs, and worked with Git.

More information about course you can find on the [website](https://documentat.io/courses/api-documentation/).
